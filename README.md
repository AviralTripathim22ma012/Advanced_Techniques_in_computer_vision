Welcome to the Advanced Computer Vision Techniques project repository! This project explores advanced techniques in computer vision, with a focus on face detection using the Viola–Jones algorithm and object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model.

## Overview

Computer vision plays a crucial role in various applications, from facial recognition systems to autonomous vehicles. This project delves into two significant techniques:

- **Viola–Jones Face Detection**: A classic method for face detection, known for its robustness and efficiency.
- **YOLO Object Detection**: A state-of-the-art deep learning model that can detect multiple objects in an image in real-time.

## Notebooks

This repository contains the following Python notebooks:

1. **Viola–Jones Face Detection**: Demonstrates how to perform face detection using the Viola–Jones algorithm.
2. **YOLO Object Detection**: Illustrates how to use the YOLO model for object detection, including installation, model loading, and inference.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the Python notebooks provided in this repository. Each notebook includes detailed explanations and code examples for implementing the respective computer vision techniques.

## Requirements

To run the notebooks, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (for YOLO object detection)

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements, additional techniques, or new notebooks, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
